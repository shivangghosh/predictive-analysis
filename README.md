## Introduction
A prodigious amount of data that is generated today is unstructured, which requires
processing to generate insights. Some examples of unstructured data are news articles,
posts on social media, and search history. Predicting the performance of a cricket
player considering all the previous statistics. Prediction is used to guess the most
accurate future output by using classification or Regression.


## Data Collection
In this project, I have used a data set created manually by combining different
datasets obtained from Kaggle with different data cleaning methods. Once the data set
is ready for processing, a trained model on processed data is implemented and is used in
the model to predict the performance of a cricket player.


## HOW DOES PREDICTION WORKS?
“Prediction” refers to the output of an algorithm after it has been trained on a historical
dataset and applied to new data when forecasting the likelihood of a particular outcome,
such as whether or not a customer will churn in 30 days. The algorithm will generate
probable values for an unknown variable for each record in the new data, allowing the
model builder to identify what that value will most likely be.

The word “prediction” can be misleading. In some cases, it really does mean that you
are predicting a future outcome, such as when you’re using machine learning to
determine the next best action in a marketing campaign. Other times, though, the
“prediction” has to do with, for example, whether or not a transaction that already
occurred was fraudulent. In that case, the transaction already happened, but you’re
making an educated guess about whether or not it was legitimate, allowing you to take
the appropriate action.
